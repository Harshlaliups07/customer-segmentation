## 📌 Objective
To segment customers into different groups using unsupervised learning so that businesses can:
- Understand customer behavior
- Target specific groups with personalized marketing
- Improve sales and customer satisfaction

---

## 📁 Dataset
- The dataset used contains information about customers such as:

## 🧪 Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Dendrogram Plotting
- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
- Data Visualization

---

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📌 Results
